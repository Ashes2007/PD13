# PD13
The expirimental PD13 github repo.
All thanks to the KMC and the NSV13 team for the overmap and vehicle system.
The codebase is a heavily modified NSV13.

  Current construction phase: Phase 1/Strip Phase
  
      Phase 1:
    We will begin with phase 1. Phase 1 consists of stripping NSV13 of all the nonesentials (Current maps, stations etc).
    The only updates we will pull from NSV13 is bugfixes that will apply to the stripped version of NSV13. It contains 3 subphases:
      -Strip Phase:
     Stripping nonessentials as before mentioned.
     -Bug Phase:
     Pull any updates that apply from NSV13. Dont you worry about this phase
     -Patch Phase:
     Re-strip after the Bug Phase, incase any fixes break current strips, If all goes well this phase shouldn't happen.

     Phase 2:
      -Planetary phase! We begin implementing planetary systems. This system is EXTREMELY lightweight. All we do is modify gravity     -systems so we always have gravity. Atmosphere will be modified to be generated and regulated automatically. This phase and beyond wil no longer pull any updates from NSV13.

    Phase 3:
     Implement phase. Add shit, we dont worry about this yet.
